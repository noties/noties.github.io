title: "@since tag to Android source distribution"

Some time ago I come up with simple enhancement for the Android source code that is distributed via SDK Manager: adding the `@since` javadoc tag to the public API. 

Just imagine:

```java
/**
* Sets a rectangular area on this view to which the view will be clipped
* when it is drawn. Setting the value to null will remove the clip bounds
* and the view will draw normally, using its full bounds.
*
* @param clipBounds The rectangular area, in the local coordinates of
* this view, to which future drawing operations will be clipped.

* @since 4.3 (18)
*/
public void setClipBounds(Rect clipBounds) {
...
```

[Issue](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37754348) on the bug tracker.

I think that adding this tag is beneficial for the overall experience when developing Android applications:

* truly offline
* do not break the loop by trying to navigate to the Android reference docs (switching context, plus navigation inside _an_ IDE is far more pleasant than the same on the web)
* provides fast feedback and improves developer memoization of API fragmentation
* do not rely on Lint checks (which _can_ backfire, especially if you already have _suppressed_ some warnings)
