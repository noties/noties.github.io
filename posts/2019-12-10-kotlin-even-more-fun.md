title: Kotlin is even more fun now!!
---

The [1.4 Kotlin](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2019/12/what-to-expect-in-kotlin-1-4-and-beyond/) announcement  contains multiple features. Among them there is the [SAM conversion](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2019/12/what-to-expect-in-kotlin-1-4-and-beyond/#language-features) for Kotlin interfaces (previously applicable for Java interfaces only). And it's definitely a _fun_ addition to the language. And it's really _funny_ (try not to _fun_!):

```kotlin
fun interface Action {
  fun run()
}
```

As much as I _fun_ the nice and warm _fun_ that fills me when working with Kotlin _fun_, I would still like to see an expansion of emotion spectrum available though. Dear Kotlin team we still need _love_, _friendship_, _honesty_, _truth_, _joy_, _trust_, _care_, _empathy_ and _hope_. And those, when added, can become a constant reminder for a developer to become a better person meanwhile maintaining productive and professional environment. Let's make the world a better _fun_!

&lt;/s&gt;
