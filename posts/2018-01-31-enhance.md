<script $>
    const page = this.$findPage('2018-01-28-since-tag.md');
</script>

It's actually a follow-up of the previous <script $>
    const page = this.$findPage('2018-01-28-since-tag.md');
    `<a href="${this.$withBase(page.url)}">${page.title}</a>`
</script>. Turned out this can be done by ourselves (plus a bit more). Here is the final result:

```java
/**
 * Called by the system when the activity changes from fullscreen mode to multi-window mode and
 * visa-versa.
 *
 * @see android.R.attr#resizeableActivity
 * @param isInMultiWindowMode True if the activity is in multi-window mode.
 * @deprecated Use {@link #onMultiWindowModeChanged(boolean, Configuration)} instead.
 * @since 7.0 Nougat (24)
 * @deprecated 8.0 Oreo (26)
 */
@Deprecated
public void onMultiWindowModeChanged(boolean isInMultiWindowMode) {
    // Left deliberately empty. There should be no side effects if a direct
    // subclass of Activity does not call super.
}
```

TLDR:  [Enhance!](https://github.com/noties/Enhance)

<p $excerpt></p>

I decided to investigate if it's possible to obtain the API versions information somehow. For starters, [documentation reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/packages.html) has it. So there must be a way to extract it. I checked the source code and found out that version info is hardcoded into CSS classes:

```html
<li class="api apilevel-21 absent" />
```

Not a very good start. And not much to do with this data even if we scrap it (packages, classes, methods, fields all must be somehow distinguished).

Well, we picked an easy target first. Let's find something of our own size. We want to enhance experience of a developer when working with an IDE ( <em>an? ;) </em>) so API version information is easily available when navigating through source code. Is there anything in *an* IDE that somehow resembles this behavior? The closest (and the only one actually) is [Lint](http://tools.android.com/tips/lint-checks) and it's `NewApi` and `Deprecated` rules.

<em>...time passed...</em>

Turned out that Lint is using the `api-versions.xml` file as an API version information storage. It is located in `{ANDROID_HOME}/platforms/android-{sdk}/data/`. It looks like this:

```xml
<class name="android/database/AbstractCursor" since="1">
	<extends name="java/lang/Object"/>
	<implements name="android/database/CrossProcessCursor"/>
	<method name="&lt;init>()V"/>
	<method name="checkPosition()V"/>
	<method name="getNotificationUri()Landroid/net/Uri;" since="11"/>
	<method name="getUpdatedField(I)Ljava/lang/Object;" deprecated="16"/>
	<method name="isFieldUpdated(I)Z" deprecated="16"/>
	<method name="onChange(Z)V"/>
	<field name="mClosed" deprecated="23"/>
	<field name="mContentResolver" deprecated="23"/>
	<field name="mCurrentRowID" deprecated="16" removed="23"/>
	<field name="mPos" deprecated="23"/>
	<field name="mRowIdColumnIndex" deprecated="16" removed="23"/>
	<field name="mUpdatedRows" deprecated="16" removed="23"/>
</class>
```

It might be scary at first if you are not on good terms with Java bytecode signatures, but it's a great source of what we are looking for.

We have our data source, but let's keep it for now, as we must find a way to apply this information to the Android source code. Of cause we won't be _compiling_ Android sources. We won't succeed anyway and what good will it give us? What we need is to find a good text processor, that will allow slight modification of some of Java code, but keeping everything else as it is.

First that comes to mind is [ANTRL](http://www.antlr.org). But I had experience with it previously and decided to look for other available options knowing that at any moment I can use ANTRL instead if I won't find anything suitable.

<em>...no time passed at all...</em>

I have found a candidate for the task pretty quickly (first result in _you-know-where_):  [Javaparser](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser). I decided to give it a go.

```java
final CompilationUnit unit;
try {
    unit = JavaParser.parse(file);
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
}
```

At this point we have already an [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) ready for traversal. I tried to modify some mock Java sources and it worked as expected. Now it was the time to glue the parts together.

At this point _glueing_ would mean solving 2 problems:

* Correctly identify traversed class
  
  In the `api-versions.xml` each class (including nested ones) are represented by independent entry, for example: `android/database/AbstractCursor`, `android/database/AbstractCursor$SelfContentObserver`

* Correctly identify traversed methods:

  In the `api-versions.xml` methods are represented as they would be in Java bytecode: `getUpdatedField(I)Ljava/lang/Object;`, `<init>(II)V`

First one is easy to solve as we are processing single source file at a time. So: one file - one package; Nested classes can be declared only in the same source file. So no problem here.

Second one is a bit harder. As we are dealing with independent source files it would be extremely hard to create a signature like this: `startIntentSenderFromChild(Landroid/app/Activity;Landroid/content/IntentSender;ILandroid/content/Intent;IIILandroid/os/Bundle;)V` without proper symbol resolution (be it manual tracking of imports or using provided by javaparser `javaparser-symbol-solver-core` artifact). So I decided to _tweak_ signature a bit to be like this: `startIntentSenderFromChild(LActivity;LIntentSender;ILIntent;IIILBundle;)V` (Please note that it's only for the _method_ signatures). We exclude package information _and_ parent info (`Landroid/app/AlertDialog$Builder;` -> `LBuilder;`). It's _not_ impossible that there will be _no_ collisions, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

Then I had another idea of what we can do _more_. As we are processing source files why not adding ... **automatic code formatting**? Android source code is a great example of consistency &lt;/s&gt; when it comes to formatting, so why not adding AOSP code formatting to it? Thankfully Google has released a tool just for this task: [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format).

Some examples of what output look like:

Final result:
```
[Enhance] processing took: 02 minutes 28 seconds
```

Not that bad for processing the whole Android source code (parse/modify/format/output) as I have encountered greater build times for a **single** Android application.
