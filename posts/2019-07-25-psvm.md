title: public static void main for Android

Sometimes I find myself wanting to evaluate some Android code without launching an app on a device or an emulator (and without adding log statements in random components). For example Java has a `public static void main` method that can be added in any class and launched right from the IDE. Can this be done for Android?

```java
public class MainActivity extends Activity {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final String input = "tel:+34 666 55 52 22";
        System.out.printf("input: %s, uri: %s%n", input, Uri.parse(input));
    }

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    }
}
```

Unfortunately this will fail with _somewhat_ famous exception:

```javastacktrace
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Stub!
	at android.net.Uri.parse(Uri.java:293)
	at io.noties.psvm.MainActivity.main(MainActivity.java:11)
```

This happens because our code is compiled with `android.jar` dependency (that can be found in `$ANDROID_SDK/platforms/android-${version}/android.jar`) that has only public API definitions. All API method signatures are present but their bodies contain a single statement: `throw new RuntimeException("Stub!")`. `android.jar` here is a _runtime_ dependency. We still can operate on public API during development, but actual implementation is provided by a device or an emulator when an app is launched.

I labeled the `java.lang.RuntimeException: Stub!` as _somewhat_ famous because you might've seen it whilst trying to launch java unit tests that contain Android code. This problem is long gone with the help of amazing [Robolectric] testing framework. But wait... this must mean that Robolectric has a proper `android.jar` with all the methods present. Can we use it?

<p $excerpt></p>

It turns out that we can. We should _substitute_ the default mocked `android.jar` with the one that comes with [Robolectric]. Add this to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    debugCompileOnly 'org.robolectric:android-all:9-robolectric-4913185-2'
}
```

You can find different versions of `android-all` artifact on [Robolectric maven][robolectric-maven] page. As you might've noticed artifact version contains Android platform version in it, so `9-robolectric-4913185-2` would mean `Android Pie (9)`. You can go with any Android version down to `4.1.2_r1-robolectric-0` (Jelly Bean!) which can be helpful if you want to evaluate code on a specific platform.

We've used the `debugCompileOnly` when adding Robolectric dependency so we do not actually introduce a compile-time dependency on full `android.jar`. But the good thing is &mdash; Intellij still allows to bundle _runtime_ dependencies when launched from the `main` method.

With that in place let's launch our main method again, click the `green play icon` to the left of your main method definition:

![launch]({{ this.$withBase('/assets/images/psvm-1.png') }})

And whoops:

```javastacktrace
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Stub!
	at android.net.Uri.parse(Uri.java:293)
	at io.noties.psvm.MainActivity.main(MainActivity.java:11)
```

There is actually another step that is required in order to launch the main method with Robolectric `android.jar`. After you have clicked the `launch` button, IDE created a _launch configuration_ which we need to modify. Expand the configurations menu and click `Edit Configurations...`

![edit configurations]({{ this.$withBase('/assets/images/psvm-2.png') }})

<style>
.psvm-ul {
    list-style: none;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
.psvm-ul li::before {
    content: "\25A0"; 
    display: inline-block;
    font-size: 1em; 
    padding-left: 8px;
    padding-right: 8px;
}
.psvm-li-red::before {
    color: #f00;
}
.psvm-li-green::before {
    color: #0f0;
}
.psvm-li-cyan::before {
    color: cyan;
}
</style>

Then,

<ul class="psvm-ul">
    <li class="psvm-li-red">Make sure <code>Include dependencies with "Provided" scope</code> is checked
    <li class="psvm-li-green">Then locate the <code>JRE</code> menu option and expand it
    <li class="psvm-li-cyan">Select appropriate Java version (instead of <code>Android API...</code>)
</ul>

![edit configurations]({{ this.$withBase('/assets/images/psvm-3.png') }})

Apply the changes to the configuration and close the window. Now, with that in place we finally can launch the main method. 

```
input: tel:+34 666 55 52 22, uri: tel:+34 666 55 52 22

Process finished with exit code 0
```

The good thing is this does not interfere with your [Robolectric] unit tests and both can be used inside a single module. Another good thing is this allows you to evaluate code that contain Android _specifics_ without launching it on a device or an emulator.
